<h3> CONDITIONS: </h3>

`Small regions of habitable forest surrounded by mountains and barren deserts. The moon's surface is dotted by bizarre architecture.`

<h3> HISTORY: </h3>

`Neither the function nor the origin of the moon's strange structures is known. Some speculate they once served a religious or artistic purpose. Despite the harsh conditions, these structures made mining and industrial efforts convenient to establish, and thus they quickly became abundant. However, resource extraction and manufacturing on the moon were abandoned as conditions became increasingly harsh. Their presence was later replaced by ░█░The Company, █▒ quickly repurposed ██▒░▒░ for ▒▒█░░█▒░▒██▒█░░░▒░██░▒▒█░▒`

<h3> FAUNA: </h3>

`The limited habitats on the moon make its forests densely populated by aggressive creatures.`

<h3> COST: </h3>

`800`

<h3> RISK LEVEL: </h3>

`S+`

## Design Philosophy

My goal with this moon (other than making a fun map for Lethal Company sessions with my friends) was to:

1. Create a moon which (relatively) fit in with the base game moons

2. Fill the niche of a lategame moon (slightly post-Titan)

3. Still introduce some new mechanics without making it feel too out of place

As much as I got a little carried away with the "new mechanics" part (especially with my 2.0.0 rework), I like to think I've been careful to preserve a bit of the vanilla feeling of the moon.

You do need to put in some work to see the really crazy stuff I have hidden, and although I recommend you give it a try, there is a config option which will disable the biggest custom additions and make the moon more vanilla friendly if you prefer that (you can find this under `Event > Vanilla Plus Mode`).

## Recommended Mods

- [**Loadstone by AdiBTW**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AdiBTW/Loadstone/) to significantly speed up load times

- My other big mod [**ScienceBird Tweaks**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ScienceBird/ScienceBird_Tweaks/), since I generally had its fixes and features in mind when I reworked this moon (and even ported some of its features)
	- The config for ScienceBird Tweaks is set to be as uninvasive as possible and make no unwanted changes or any changes to gameplay at all, so it should be easy to slide in, but you can dig deep into its various options if you want to

## Numbers for Nerds

I lament that moons don't often tell you their exact stats, so in case you want to know, here are the important values for Wither (beware of spoilers if you want to keep the moon's scrap and enemy spawns mysterious):
