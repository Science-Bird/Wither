<h3> CONDITIONS: </h3>

`Small regions of habitable forest surrounded by mountains and barren deserts. The moon's surface is dotted by bizarre architecture.`

<h3> HISTORY: </h3>

`Neither the function nor the origin of the moon's strange structures is known. Some speculate they once served a religious or artistic purpose. It's also unclear how long the moon's environment has been in this strangely divided state. More recently, industrial efforts were set up in its forests, but now lie abandoned. Only The Company still has operations here.`

<h3> FAUNA: </h3>

`The limited habitats on the moon make its forests densely populated by aggressive creatures.`

<h3> COST: </h3>

`800`

<h3> RISK LEVEL: </h3>

`S+`

## Design Philosophy

My goal with this moon (other than making a fun map for Lethal Company sessions with my friends) was to:

1. Create a moon which (relatively) fit in with the base game moons

2. Fill the niche of a lategame moon (slightly post-Titan)

3. Still introduce some new mechanics without making it feel too out of place

I have experience with programming and mapmaking in other mediums, but Unity is still new to me. So, especially given the new mechanics I've tried to implement, please forgive any issues and let me know about them so I can try to fix them!

## Recommended Mods

If you don't have them already, try using [**Loadstone by AdiBTW**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AdiBTW/Loadstone/) to significantly speed up load times and [**LCMaxSoundsFix by Hardy**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hardy/LCMaxSoundsFix/) if you encounter issues with sound effects being cut off.

## Numbers for Nerds

I lament that moons don't often tell you their exact stats, so in case you want to know, here are the important values for Wither (beware of spoilers if you want to keep the moon's scrap and enemy spawns mysterious):
